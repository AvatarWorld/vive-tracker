    This file should be a PSoC library to control a Xbee in API mode.
    
    Unfortunately, because of 2018's project evolution (moving from a main
    robot with a lattepanda to the summberbot using a teensy and lack of time),
    this library is not finished. Now, the idea is to create a Hardware
    Abstraction Library like the TS4231_driver to be able to use a XBee for
    trackers peer communication after another work of making an XBee_commands
    _manager.
